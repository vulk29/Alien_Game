# Alien_Game
This is a working version of the Alien Game used in the Alien Project. The game doesn't collect any data (or rather the data collection link is not working at the moment). 
An illustration of the game play is available here: https://youtu.be/b8BCkq93ovc
If you are not a github user, you can simply click on the download button to download the entire folder as a zip. After you unzip the archive, to play the game, navigate to the Alien Game PC folder and run the v.01 application. Please preserve the exact structure of the folder to insure the game works.

If you are interested in using the game for research, please be in touch! We are currently unable to secure the resources to maintain it, but that may change in the future. 

Enjoy!
