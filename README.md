# Alien_Game
This is a working version of the Alien Game used in the Alien Project. The game doesn't collect any data (or rather the data collection link is not working at the moment). Please preserve the exact structure of the folder to insure the game works.

If you are not a github user, you can simply click on the download button to download the entire folder as a zip. To play the game, navigate to the Alien Game PC folder and run the v.01 application. 

If you are interested in using the game for research, please be in touch! We are currently unable to secure the resources to maintain this game, but that may change in the future. 

Enjoy!
