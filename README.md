# Alien_Game
This is a working version of the Alien Game used in the Alien Project. The game doesn't collect any data (or rather the data collection link is not working at the moment). Please preserve the exact structure of the folder to insure the game works.

If you are not a github user, you can simply click on the download button to download the entire folder as a zip. Navigate to the Alien Game PC folder and run the v.01 application. 

Enjoy!
